This file is my attempt at creating a simple neural network from scratch. While it's simple to just use scikitlearn I thought it would be intersting to look into the mathmatics of how neural networks actaully learn. 
This code is for anyone that wants a higher level underdtanding on neural network
Specially formatted for the MNIST dataset
